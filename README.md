# Clair Nolan - Data Analyst & Educator
## About
Hi, I’m Clair Nolan! As a math major, I am obsessed with data. I am good at spotting patterns and  turning data into clear, actionable insights. My attention to detail, accuracy,ability to work well in teams, strong desire to acquire new skills,excellent communication and presenting skills, makes me a perfect candidate of a data analyst. 
I have acquired a lot of certifications, such as Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Professional Certificate,Google Data Analytics Certificate and Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate. Currently I am working on PL-300 and AWS Clould Practitioner certifications.With experience in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel, I enjoy working on real-world data projects and turning raw data into meaningful insights. 
I am detail-oriented, work well in teams, and excel as a storyteller and effective presenter—skills developed through my experience as a teacher and my naturally engaging communication style.. 
When I’m not analyzing data or teaching, I like exploring new technologies, improving my coding skills, and working on personal projects.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.


## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Hr Analytic Job Prediction  
**Code:** [`Hr Analytic Job Prediction.ipynb`](https://github.com/Clairzhq/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Hr%20Analytic%20Job%20Prediction.ipynb)

**Goal:** create a model that predicts employee attrition. The successful implementation of this predictive model will equip Salifort Motors with valuable insights, enabling them to make data-driven decisions to retain their workforce. A comprehensive analysis of the HR dataset has been conducted, and data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering have been carried out to prepare the data for model development.  

**Description:** TSalifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. Its global workforce of over 100,000 employees research, design, construct, validate, and distribute electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. Salifort’s end-to-end vertical integration model has made it a global leader at the intersection of alternative energy and automobiles.For this deliverable, I will choose a method to approach this data challenge , selecting either a regression model or a machine learning model to predict whether an employee will leave the company.
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis,data visualization, data modelling

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and sklearn.

**Insights:**
1.If employees aren't familiar with the company's overtime pay policies, inform them about this. If the expectations around workload and time off aren't explicit, make them clear. 
2. Hold company-wide and within-team discussions to understand and address the company work culture, across the board and in specific contexts. 
3.High evaluation scores should not be reserved for employees who work 200+ hours per month. Consider a proportionate scale for rewarding employees who contribute more/put in more effort. 
4.Consider promoting employees who have been with the company for at least four years, or conduct further investigation about why four-year tenured employees are so dissatisfied. 
5.Either reward employees for working longer hours, or don't require them to do so.

###   Cyclistic Rider Analysis
**Code:** [`Cyclistic Rider Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/Clairzhq/Cyclistic-Rider-Analysis/blob/main/Cyclistic%20Rider%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** This project aims to find out how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently and design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders to annual members.  

**Description:** Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of ridersprefer too traditional bike and about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute work.  

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, pattern recognition, data visualization and data modeling.  

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  

**Results:** . Five stations had fewer than two trips, indicating possible removal. Tuesday was the most popular day with balanced rider types, while Wednesday had more subscribers. July and September saw peak usage, mostly by subscribers, while May and June had the least activity with no casual riders. A/B tests showed trip distance and duration correlate with user type, and a logistic model predicted user type with 72.4% accuracy.
